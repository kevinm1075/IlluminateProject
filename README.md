VS project for the Illuminate game/solver website.

"Lights Out" was a puzzle game created in 1997 where the user tried to turn all the lights on the game board off. In this project, we have chosen to recreate a similar game, instead now the user tries to turn the lights on!

The main focus of this project is to develop a search-based AI capable of solving the puzzle in the fewest amount of steps. If the player ever needs help, they just simply need to click the "Solve" button and the AI will solve the board from its current state. 

### To Do:
- Bug: Footer CSS does not stay at bottom of page during resizes and at lower resolutions.
- Bug: Canvas onClick breaks when browser window is resized.
- Add: Create more puzzles.
- Add: Better way of displaying moves to solve.
- Add: Make design improvements to interface.
- AI: Heuristic improvements are possible.
