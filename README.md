"Lights Out" was a puzzle game created in 1997 where the user tried to turn all the lights on the game board off. In this project, we have chosen to recreate a similar game, instead now the user tries to turn the lights on!

The main focus of this project is to develop an AI capable of solving the puzzle in the fewest amount of steps. If the player ever needs help, they just simply need to click the "Solve" button and the AI will solve the board from its current state. 

To Do:
Format CSS styling so that lower resolutions doesn't look garbled.  
Create and add many more puzzles.  
Implement a cleaner way of displaying moves to solve, and current amount of clicks.
